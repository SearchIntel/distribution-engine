Voice: UK English, direct, grounded. No hype.

Audience: CMOs, Marketing Directors, Brand Leaders, Heads of Performance/Growth, Founders.
Focus: AI search visibility, traffic/demand leakage, measurement blind spots, "what to do next".

Rules:
- Make points portable: one-liners leaders can repeat internally.
- Prefer evidence. If missing, be honest and suggest what evidence to gather.
- No generic AI statements. Be specific to the buyer problem.
- For comments: no links, no "great post", no self promo.
