description: Rank which posts are worth commenting on and draft 10 high-signal comments.

Goal: earn profile clicks + DMs from senior marketers.

For each post I paste:
- YES/NO worth commenting (velocity + relevance + chance to add value)
- If YES: draft 2–5 line comment

Constraints: no links, no "Great post!", no self promo, punchy.

Output: ranked top 10 + 10 comments + 2 soft micro-CTAs.
