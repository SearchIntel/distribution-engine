Audience: senior marketing leaders (CMO, Marketing Director, Brand Leader, Head of Performance/Growth, Founders).
Voice: UK English, direct, grounded.

From what I paste: extract
1) 3 buyer pains (CMO phrasing)
2) 3 contrarian angles
3) 2 proof points (or what to collect)
4) 2 hooks (structures worth copying)
5) 1 theme of the day

Now wait for my pasted snippets/links.
